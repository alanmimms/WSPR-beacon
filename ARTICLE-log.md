# WSPR Beacon Development Log
## AI-Human Collaboration Documentation for QST/QEX Article

**Project**: ESP32-based WSPR Beacon with Web Interface  
**Participants**: Alan Mimms (WB7NAB) and Claude Code (Anthropic AI)  
**Purpose**: Document the collaborative development process for ARRL publication

## Development Sessions

### Session [Current] - Source Tree Reorganization & UI Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Focus**: Architecture cleanup, persistent header/footer implementation  

#### Key Interactions:

**Human Request**: "look at this repo. I want to improve the UI and documentation for the beacon. I have some ideas about what to do."

**AI Analysis**: [Analyzed repository structure, identified issues with BeaconFSM vs Beacon+FSM architecture duplication]

**Human**: "Before we do that, some basic structure fixes. Explain why BeaconFSM and FSM and Beacon all exist in the src dir. Is any of this obsolete?"

**AI Response**: [Identified architectural redundancy - BeaconFSM was active but FSM+Beacon was a cleaner modular approach that wasn't being used]

**Human**: "What are you waiting for?"

**AI Action**: [Immediately began refactoring to eliminate BeaconFSM and implement cleaner Beacon+FSM architecture]

#### Technical Achievements:
- Eliminated duplicate BeaconFSM implementation
- Reorganized source tree into `src/core/`, `platform/esp32/`, `platform/host-mock/`
- Renamed `target/` to `target-esp32/` for clarity
- Implemented persistent header with centered state indicator
- Added persistent footer with real-time status
- Removed redundant "Current Status" box

#### Collaboration Patterns Observed:
1. **Proactive Analysis**: AI examined entire codebase before suggesting improvements
2. **Incremental Development**: Changes made step-by-step with testing
3. **Architecture First**: Structural issues addressed before UI improvements
4. **Human Direction**: AI waited for explicit permission before major changes
5. **Documentation Sync**: README requirements drove implementation details
