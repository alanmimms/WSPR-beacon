This is an ESP32 based WSPR encoder with additional capabilities to do
other JTEncoder modes some day.

In the `components/jtencoder` directory I started with the GPL'ed
JTEncoder source code and rewrote most of it vibe coding with Google
Gemini 2.5Pro. I think the result is simpler and easier to use and
understand.
