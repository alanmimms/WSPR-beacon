This is an ESP32 based WSPR encoder with additional capabilities to do
other JTEncoder modes some day.

In the `components/jtencoder` directory I started with the GPL'ed
JTEncoder source code and rewrote most of it by [vibe coding with
Google Gemini 2.5Pro](https://g.co/gemini/share/7c0f292dc869). I think
the result is simpler and easier to use and understand. I enjoyed
using AI to do this, although it was not without its frustrations.
